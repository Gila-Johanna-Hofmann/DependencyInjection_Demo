# Dependency Injection Demo with a .NET6 Console Application
A very basic example of how dependency injection works in a console application (as opposed to a .NET Web App), annotated with a lot of comments for a better understanding of the code and the topic in general.

# Acknowledgments
I followed [CroninTechnologiys Youtube Tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection-usage) to practice dependency injection.
